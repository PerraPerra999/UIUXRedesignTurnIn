                    <h6>This project explores the workflow of redesigning a simple website.
                        Identifying flaw, hardening skills, analyzing accessibility flaws, and
                        building a responsive website with prototypes are essential to the process
                        behind UI/UX design.

                        This part selects the main website of the project. Ideally, it's one that's 
                        public but not made by a large corportation (eg. Google, Facebook). For this project,
                        8 Degrees LLC company's website was chosen. 8 Degrees is most widely known for their 
                        When2Meet software which is used by a large number of people and organizations.

                            <p>
                                I chose this website because When2Meet is a staple for a lot of organizations and its company website doesn’t look polished or taken care of. If I had to guess, I would say this company is no longer active as of 2006.

                                    Two errors and 15 alerts were detected with the website. Most of them applied to missing metadata such as not specifying a language or including tags for sections for different sections (text or images a direct child of <html> instead of a <a>, <p>..etc). I agree with these detections and would even expand it to say that the different headings are not specifically defined properly.

                        A style guide with clear documentation makes design work more consistent
                        and makes working with other developers easier. This part of the project
